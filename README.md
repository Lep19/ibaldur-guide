Hey. Have you seen that trick? The one where you kill the Baldur in front of Greenpath without any spells? Let's talk about how to do it.

# Intro
## To start, a brief summary of how it works:
- We can only hit the Baldur when it's open, but if we just walk up to it it'll close before we can reach it with our nail
Clip of normal walking up
- It can only close if it's fully open, so if we re-enter its range while it's still in the opening animation it'll delay its close. This still doesn't quite give us enough time to reach it
Clip of wiggle with no damage
- BUT, damage knockback moves us faster than normal walking, and that extra speed plus the delayed close gets us there just in time to land a hit. We can even fit a second hit in since the first hit causes the Baldur to recoil
Clip of successful rotation

So, for our setup, we need:
- A cue for when the shade is close enough to hit us at the right time
- What we'll call a "wiggle" to time the Baldur's opening and closing
- A cue for where to stand when we get hit so we enter the Baldur's range correctly
- A well timed nail slash

We'll also be talking about health/soul management and healing setups since most categories will use Fury of the Fallen, but of course you can disregard that part if you're not. On that note, you can enter with less health and soul than I'll be showing, and you can greed the heals more if you like, but I'll be showing what I consider to be the most reliable health management that allows for a few failed rotations and doesn't risk getting hit with a spit while you're healing. Keep an eye on current, active runners for the most up-to-date strats.

And, as a final note, we'll be using [Staxis's practice mod](https://github.com/staxissr/ibaldurPractice/releases). I'll also link [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlfAHsPH4wg&list=PLH-aXtMsmPYq8ZvwV9G7s3uIz_6AlIygz&index=2) guide on how to set up a modded install for practice if you don't already have one (see part 1 of that guide for making a separate install if you havenâ€™t already).
